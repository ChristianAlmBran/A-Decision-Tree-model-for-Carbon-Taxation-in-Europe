# A Decision Tree Model for Carbon Taxation in Europe

## Overview
This repository contains the data and information necessary to reproduce the research presented in the Master's dissertation: Green Influence, Economic Realities, and Political Landscapes: Understanding Carbon Tax Determinants in Europe using Machine Learning.

## Data
The only data file needed to reproduce the decision tree model is the "all_cabinets_all_features.csv." The other data files were added to facilitate the reproducibility of the information on the main data frame.

## Code
When attempting to run the decision tree model files, it is necessary to run the "code_to_load_main_data_frame" file first, as it contains the code to access and load the main data frame.

## Statistical information and plots
The folder "confusion_matrix_decision_tree_feature_importance" houses essential information such as the confusion matrices with the models' statistical details, decision tree plots, and feature importance plots.
